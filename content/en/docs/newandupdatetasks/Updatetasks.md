To update a task, select the task and then select the checkmark icon on the toolbar or press the Enter key, to write updates to storage.

#### Global Changes

Global Changes, choose the Global icon on toolbar, applies to either *all* or *selected tasks*. Global changes, either partial or complete string modifications, can be applied to all tasks simultaneously. While updating tasks individually may be feasible, this method is more effective for modifying all tasks in one go.

#### Catalogs

Selecting the "Home" icon displays all catalogs from your "$Home" directory. If a local disk is attached, the mounted volumes are also presented. Select the home catalog and the mounted volume. Return to the main Task view, and RsyncUI will suggest some values.
