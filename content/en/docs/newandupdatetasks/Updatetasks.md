To update a task, select it and press the update button to write changes to storage.

#### Global Changes

Global Changes (the Global icon on the toolbar) apply to *all* or *selected tasks*. Global changes can apply partial or complete string modifications to all tasks simultaneously. This is more effective than updating tasks individually.

#### Directories

Selecting the "Home" icon displays all directories from your "$Home" directory. If a local disk is attached, the mounted volumes are also presented. Select the home directory and the mounted volume. Return to the main Task view, and RsyncUI will suggest some values.
