#### Global Changes

Global Changes, choose the Global icon on toolbar, applies to either *all* or *selected tasks*. Global changes, either partial or complete string modifications, can be applied to all tasks simultaneously. While updating tasks individually may be feasible, this method is more effective for modifying all tasks in one go.

#### Directories

Selecting the "Home" icon displays all directories from your "$Home" directory. If a local disk is attached, the mounted volumes are also presented. Select the home directory and the mounted volume. Return to the main Task view, and RsyncUI will suggest some values.
