*RsyncUI* is a macOS application developed using Swift and SwiftUI, designed for macOS Sonoma and subsequent versions. It leverages the command-line tool rsync for file synchronization. Notably, rsync executes the synchronization tasks, while RsyncUI provides a graphical user interface (GUI) on top of rsync. RsyncUI is 100% open-source software and will remain absolutely free for all time.

RsyncUI is *digitally signed* and *notarized* by Apple, ensuring its security and preventing malicious code and tampering.

**Important Note:** RsyncUI is a specialized application designed exclusively for backup and secure file management. It operates in conjunction with the command-line tool rsync, which is responsible for the actual synchronization process. If you are seeking a comprehensive backup solution that can create a complete image of your drive for restoration in the event of a catastrophic event, RsyncUI is not the appropriate tool for your needs.

As a safety precaution, the --delete parameter is *not* set as a default parameter when adding new tasks. To ensure that the source and destination are in complete synchronization, the --delete parameter must be *enabled*. If you are new to `rsync`, I strongly recommend reading the *"Important"*  and *"Limitations"* sections as a minimum.

### Privacy statement

RsyncUI is a desktop application only, there is no server component. It does not generate any logs that are transmitted from your Mac. Data pertaining to tasks and logs is stored locally on your Mac as files. You can backup all files created by RsyncUI to the Document directory on your Mac from the Settings view. The sole data transferred from your Mac to a server occurs only if you enable tasks with a remote server destination. You bear sole responsibility for securing your own data if synchronized to a remote server.
