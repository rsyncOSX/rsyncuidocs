Note: Be aware of if using syncremote, the *remote folder must be added first* and  the *local folder as second*. This is fixed in code which make RsyncUI to flip folders. To be relased later as a maintenance release. This only apply to the quick task.

Use QuickTask for quickly copy or transfer files to either local or remote storage. QuickTask will save the last executed quick task as default values. Default values can be cleared by the toolbar function.

There are two types of quick tasks:

- `synchronize`: Synchronize local files to remote.
- `syncremote`: Synchronize remote files to local.

If `syncremote`, the local catalog in the form is the remote data, and the remote catalog is the local data where the remote data will be stored when pulled.

After entering data, the default task is a `--dry-run` task. It is recommended to inspect the result before executing the actual run.
