For new users, kindly refer to the *Important* section. Additionally, please find information about the latest version of rsync to install, refer to the *Latest version of rsync* section .

The primary Sidebar menu is context-sensitive. The rationale behind a context-sensitive Sidebar menu is to conceal menu options that may be distracting to the user.  See last on this page about the sidebar menu options.

#### New Tasks and Verification

RsyncUI supports synchronizing data to:

- local attached disk
- remote servers on the Internet or local LAN
    - requiere *passwordless login*  by ssh-key

##### Local attached disk

RsyncUI can synchronize your data to a local attached disk. If you only want to synchronize data to a local attached disk, connect the disk, add the source and destination, and you are ready for your first task.

##### Remote server and passwordless login

If you want to synchronize data to a server, on the Internet, or your local LAN, there is some more setup to do. If you have enabled *passwordless login* by ssh-key, you only have to add *source*, *destination*, *login id*, and *servername* and you are ready to synchronize data. If you have *not* enabled passwordless login, there are some more actions required before your first task.

**Verify tasks**

{{< alert color="warning" >}}

*Always* verify a new task. After adding a new task, changed a task, added your own or changed parameters to rsync , select the *"Verify tasks"* from the primary Sidebar menu. 

{{< /alert >}}

 Select the task and press the *play* button on the toolbar. Executing the *play* button includes the --dry-run parameter for rsync, which is an estimation run.

##### Aborting tasks

Please note that this is an external task not controlled by RsyncUI, which executes the command-line tool `rsync`. RsyncUI monitors the task for progress and termination.

The user can abort a task at any time. However, it is essential to allow the task to complete and perform any necessary cleanup operations before starting a new task. This process may take a few seconds, and if not, the applications may become unresponsive.

#### The Sidebar Menu options

There are three Sidebar menu options that are contingent upon the properties of a task. It is sufficient as long as one of the tasks satisfies one of the prerequisites.

- *Snapshot*: this option is exclusively available for snapshot tasks
- *Restore*: this option is only available for synchronize- and snapshot tasks where *the destination* is located on a *remote server*
- *Verify remote*: this option is only available for synchronize tasks where *the destination* is located on a *remote server*

#### The Calendar

A note about the Calendar and schedule of actions. There are limitations of how the scheduler works due to how the Timer library is developed. Refer to the blog *Timer and Calendar* for more detailed info about the Timer.

Its primary function is to automate selected synchronization of tasks as long as RsyncUI is alive and you are logged in. It *may* prove useful for users who require scheduled  synchronization of data during work.  RsyncUI may be minimized or not the active window and the timer will still work. But if you leave your Mac and it goes to sleep, the timer will *not work*.

{{< alert >}}

The scheduler is implemented by using the Timer library, quote Apple: *"A timer that fires after a certain time interval has elapsed, sending a specified message to a target object."* 

{{< /alert >}}

The timer has a strong reference to the run loop on the main thread. That also means that if the application goes to sleep, so does the run loop. And the timer is only active as long as RsyncUI is active.
