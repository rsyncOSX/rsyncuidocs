Tasks can be organized in profiles. A profile is the name of the catalog located at the storage location where RsyncUI stores its files. When you create a "newprofile," RsyncUI creates a new catalog at `$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber/newprofile`. Tasks and logfiles are stored within that catalog for that profile.

The list on the right side of the view displays all tasks that have not been updated since the number of days specified in the settings under the "Mark days after" option.
