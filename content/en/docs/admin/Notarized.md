RsyncUI is digitally signed with my Apple Developer Certificate and notarized (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) by Apple. This verification process ensures that the application is free from malicious code and will seamlessly integrate with Apple's Gatekeeper technology. Upon opening either a new or updated application for the first time, Apple will issue a notification.
