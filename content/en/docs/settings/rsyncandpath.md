After changing a setting, you have to save the changes to keep it next time you use RsyncUI.

#### Version of rsync

It is recommended to install the latest version of `rsync`. RsyncUI provides direct path support for Homebrew on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. `RsyncUI` will determine the type of Mac you are using. The default path for Homebrew is:

- Intel-based Mac: `/usr/local/bin`
- Apple Silicon: `/opt/homebrew/bin`

#### Path rsync

The *snapshot* and *syncremote* feature requires the latest version of `rsync`. If an updated or new version of `rsync` is not installed by Homebrew, set the path to `rsync`.

- If `Rsync v3.x` is enabled, set the *optional path* if not installed by Homebrew.
- Any version of `rsync` will work, but only default versions in macOS and the latest release of rsync have been tested and verified.
	- the test and verification process ensures the accurate parsing of the output generated by rsync

#### Path for restore

- Preset temporary path for restoring single files and directory
- Preset temporary path for a full restore

#### Mark days after

Tasks with an execution date older than the number of days are marked red.

#### Backup configurations

You can backup the current setup, configurations, and logs, including all profiles, at any time by clicking the `wrench` button.
The backup executes a copy to your Documents directory and appends a timestamp `-month-day-year/hour/minute` to the copy.

The backups are located in your Documents directory: `$HOME/Documents/RsyncUIcopy-05-06-2024/08/21`
