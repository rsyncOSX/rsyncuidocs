Several settings can be adjusted. After changing a setting, save the changes to keep them next time you use RsyncUI. Access your settings with the shortcut `⌘,`.

- *Rsync and path* - settings for rsync and path
- *Log settings* - settings logging
- *SSH* - settings for SSH
- *Environment* - setting environment variables for SSH, there are several variables that can be set, but RsyncUI only supports one environment variable

The “About" section displays the version of rsync in use and the path for storing and retrieving configurations to the permanent storage location.
