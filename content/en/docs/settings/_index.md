There are several settings that can be adjusted. After changing a setting, you have to save the changes to keep it next time you use RsyncUI. Users can access their settings by default using the shortcut `⌘,`.

- *Rsync and path* - settings for rsync and path
- *Log settings* - settings logging
- *SSH* - settings for SSH
- *Environment* - setting environment variables for SSH, there are several variables that can be set, but RsyncUI only supports one environment variable

The “About" section displays the version of rsync in use and the path for storing and retrieving configurations to the permanent storage location.
