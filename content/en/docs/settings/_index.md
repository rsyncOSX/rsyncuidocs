There are several settings that can be adjusted. These settings are saved to a permanent storage location.
Users can access their settings by default using the shortcut `âŒ˜,`.

- **Rsync and Path:** - Settings for rsync and path
- **Monitor and Log:** - Settings for monitoring and logging
- **SSH:** - Settings for SSH
- **Environment:** - Setting environment variables for SSH. There are several variables that can be set, but RsyncUI only supports one environment variable.

The "Info" section displays the version of rsync in use and the path for storing and retrieving configurations to the permanent storage location.
