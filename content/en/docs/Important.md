Before using RsyncUI, review these key notes.

The interface may feel challenging if you are new to the `rsync` command-line tool. RsyncUI focuses on making `rsync` easier to use, not on teaching every `rsync` concept.

### Not a backup tool for everyone

RsyncUI specializes in synchronization and file management. The command-line tool rsync performs the actual work. If you need a full system backup tool that creates complete disk images, RsyncUI is not the right fit.

### Delete parameter 

The `--delete` parameter keeps the destination in exact sync with the source. When a file is removed from the source, rsync removes it from the destination. With `--delete` disabled, the destination will accumulate files removed from the source.

Know whether `--delete` is on or off before you run; it controls whether the destination mirrors the source.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  
As a safety precaution, `--delete` is *not* enabled by default on new tasks. Turn it on if you need the destination to mirror the source.

</div>

#### Add and remove the delete parameter

Select *Parameters* tab within the Tasks menu, select the task, and toggle *Add --delete parameter* (**ON** means included). After toggling, remember to update the task.

- if ON, the --delete parameter is included
- if OFF, the --delete parameter is removed

### Always verify new task

Before running a new task, perform a `--dry-run` and inspect the result. If you set an empty source and `--delete` is enabled, rsync will delete all files in the destination.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

Incorrect rsync parameters can delete data, and RsyncUI does not block such choices. See *Getting started* or *New tasks* for how to verify a task before running it.

</div>

### Temporary halt tasks

You can temporarily halt a task. In the Synchronize view, right-click a task to halt it; the task keeps its type when resumed. Halted tasks display a red stop sign in the action column.

### Two options to save updates to data

This option applies to the data synchronized by RsyncUI. By enabling either of these options, you can save changes to data, such as deletions or updates, prior to a synchronization task.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">

There are two options to automatically save changes to data when it is changed or deleted. 

**Option 1:** `rsync` supports a *backup* flag. Switching this *on* in the *Rsync parameters* view adds the required parameters. You may change the backup directory to any location you want.  

**Option 2:** *Snapshots* require rsync 3.x. See *Snapshots* for details on enabling and using them.
