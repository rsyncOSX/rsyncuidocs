### Version 2.7.5 (build 166) - in development

The development of version 2.7.5 has commenced. Currently, only a few UI updates have been implemented. This version is scheduled for release in November 2025. Prior to the release of a release candidate (RC), there will be some changes made. The graphical user interface (GUI) updates require a period of time to mature before they are finalized.

The functions *Schedule* and *Verify remote* have been moved from the main sidebar to the toolbar. This modification enhances the cleanliness of the main sidebar by consolidating major functions. 

To display and access the toolbar actions for the two above mentioned functions, they must be enabled through the RsyncUI settings.
