### Version 2.7.1 (build 162) - NOT YET RELEASED

The following are updates to be released sometime after release of version 2.7.0. Version 2.7.1 requires additional testing before its release.

### Some issues about default rsync version in macOS

The default version of rsync in macOS is `openrsync`. There are some issues with this version and RsyncUI. Please read the blog post *Rsync versions*. 

### Adjusting output from rsync

The last 16 rows for rsync version 3.x provide a summarized status of the task. The progress bar accurately reflects the current number of rows being processed during the rsync operation. Additionally, the adjustment of output does not include the final status lines, and the maximum number of files to be synchronized is also modified accordingly. If there are five files to be transferred, the total number of output lines generated by rsync will be 5 + 16 = 21. After adjusting the progress barâ€™s maximum size to 5, the counting of files is halted when the start of status lines is detected.

The above makes the progress bar more accurate.

### Restrictions with openrsync

Version 2.7.1 of RsyncUI will impose certain restrictions on the operations permitted when using the default version of rsync in macOS. These restrictions will only permit standard synchronization tasks and will prohibit snapshot or syncremote tasks.
