### Version 2.3.6 (build 136) - 7 March 2025

*Please note that there are currently missing localizations in German and Norwegian. The next version will include updated localizations. Due to the urgency of the bug, it was prioritized to release a quick update rather than address the localization issues.*

A **bug exists in the discover function when data synchronization is required**. This bug may prevent RsyncUI from marking a repository for updates, even when there are new and modified files to be synchronized. The release also includes a few UI enhancements and internal code refactoring. 

Another pleasant aspect of constructing a new release using Makefile and command-line tools is the simplicity of the build, notarization, and signing process, which can be completed in a matter of minutes.  Creating a new release is now done in 3-4 minutes by Makefile and  command-line tools. 

The three only manual updates are:

- updating the new release on GitHub releases
    - uploading the new dmg file, compute the SHA256 checksum for the dmg file,  add the GitHub Full Changlog
- updating the GitHub file for notify of a new version
    - RsyncUI pulls a version file, a JSON file, from GitHub at startup and decide if there is an update
-  creating a new pull request for Homebrew about new version

### How to verify from main view

To verify the availability of data for synchronization, inspect the output generated by rsync. This can be obtained from either the summarized estimated view or the main view, and by selecting the corresponding task.

Alternatively, you can initiate a synchronize operation without prior estimation by clicking the play icon on the toolbar. This action will either synchronize all tasks or the selected tasks, respectively, performing a comprehensive synchronization of the data.

After selecting the task, locate the magnifyingglass icon on the toolbar. This icon will display the output generated by the rsync command. The output from rsync indicates that there are no modified files.

### How to verify from summarized estimated view

Or from the summarized estimated view, blue numbers indicates there are updates:

After selecting a task, the output from rsync shows there are *data* to be synchronized.
