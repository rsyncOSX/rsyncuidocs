### Version 2.3.7 (build 137) - 7 March 2025

I sincerely apologize for the two consecutive updates on the same day. And issue is still not fixed in release. But the issue is fixed in code. There will be released a new version early next week, where localization issues are fixed and QA of bugfix is properly completed.

Additionally, a release candidate has been uploaded where the aforementioned issues have been resolved, to be verified before the release of the next version. After estimating, the summarized view will be presented even if there is no data to be synchronized. This will be a setting that can be turned on and off in the next release.
