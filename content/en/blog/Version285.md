### Version 2.8.5 - In development

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  
This version introduces several modifications. Additionally, I anticipate the implementation of minor updates and bug fixes, as well as a comprehensive quality assurance and review process. A release candidate is scheduled for early January 2026, followed by a final release in January 2026.

</div>

The primary advancement in this version is the implementation of significant user interface (UI) enhancements. These updates were requested by GitHub user @timreichen (Tim Reichen) to enhance the intuitiveness of RsyncUI. Thanks to Tim for his input.

The UI improvements utilize the Inspector *like* view to provide detailed information about tasks. Adding new tasks is now facilitated through a dedicated sheet. Selecting a task displays its associated details. Additionally, a toggle on the toolbar allows users to switch between viewing task data and parameters.
