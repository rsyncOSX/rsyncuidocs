### Version 2.5.0 (build 142) - work in progress

The development of a scheduler is progressing slowly, but steadily. The plan includes a scheduled backup function to RsyncUI. Recent development has been limited. During the spring and summer months, I prioritize capturing bird photographs. There may be some development during these periods, but the plan remains to release a new version after summer. It is also beneficial to periodically cease development and allow for catch-up. 

The scheduler is not an advanced scheduling tool. Its primary function is to automate selected synchronization tasks as long as RsyncUI is in operation. It *may* prove useful for users who require regular data synchronization during their work.

The Norwegian and German localization are also been removed from this version. Regrettably, due to my limited proficiency in German, I am unable to provide a comprehensive translation in German. From this version, RsyncUI speaks English only.
