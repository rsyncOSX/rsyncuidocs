### Version 2.7.0 (build 161) - release candidate

The next version, 2.7.x build 16x, will be released **after** macOS Tahoe 26 is released. 

Currently, there are no plans to add any macOS Tahoe 26-specific features, such as Liquid Glass properties for buttons. The next version will be compiled with Xcode 26 on macOS Tahoe 26 and will adapt any default UI settings by the running version of macOS. However, there may be some macOS Tahoe 26-specific properties in future version 2.7.x of RsyncUI.

### Adjusting output from rsync

Not yet released as rc.

The last 16 or 14 rows, for rsync version 3.x and openrsync (the default rsync in macOS), provide a summarized status of the task. The progress bar accurately reflects the current number of rows being processed during the rsync operation. Additionally, the adjustment of output does not include the final status lines, and the maximum number of files to be synchronized is also modified accordingly.

If there are five files to be transferred, the total number of output lines generated by rsync will be 5 + 16 = 21. After adjusting the progress bar's maximum size to 5, the counting of files is halted when the start of status lines is detected.

The above makes the progress bar more accurate.

### Some observations about macOS Tahoe 26

One of my Macs is currently installed and updated with the latest developer release of macOS Tahoe. However, there are still some minor, non-critical bugs with RsyncUI on macOS 26. Specifically, the color of the charts is not displayed as expected, and plurals are not handled correctly. On macOS Sequoia 15.x, plurals are displayed correctly and colors in the charts.

Swift handles plurals by applying the `inflect` keyword.

```swift
.confirmationDialog("Delete ^[\(selectedloguuids.count) log](inflect: true)",
                                    isPresented: $confirmdelete)
                {
                    Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
                        deletelogs(selectedloguuids)
                    }
                }
```

In *Log listings* view, as an example, selection two logs for delete. On macOS Tahoe 26, pop ups a dialog like `Delete ^[2 log](inflect: true)` which should be `Delete 2 logs`. I assume these bugs will be fixed before release of the new macOS.

**Update 9 September:** Apple has released release candidates (RC1) for macOS Tahoe 26 and Xcode 26, but the issue above remains unresolved.

#### Charts

Development is progressing. The rc was updated September 5. 

The log records generated by RsyncUI provide detailed information about file transfers, including the date, number of files transferred, and the total data transferred in megabytes (MB). All numerical data extracted from the log records is derived from the output of the rsync command. 

While it is uncertain whether any charts of this data are of interest, I have begun testing data extraction and presenting some charts. As development is still in its early stages, I welcome any ideas you may have. Please feel free to contact me via email thomeven@gmail.com.

I utilize RsyncUI on a daily basis to secure data changes and updates, including development and photographic files, by backing them up externally. The parsing of log records extracts only **one record** per day, either based on the maximum number of files or the maximum transferred size. 

You can also configure the number of records to display in the chart. For instance, if you have approximately 500 log records and set the number to 10, the chart data selects the 10 dates with the highest data volume, either in terms of the number of files or the maximum transferred data.
