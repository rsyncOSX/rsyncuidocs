### Version 2.8.4 - Dec 26, 2025

Version 2.8.4rc2 has been released as the new version, with no new builds released.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">

In version 2.8.2, there is an issue with the "empty stats file". For more information, please refer to the blog posts about version 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. I believe I have identified the cause of this issue. The previous *RsyncProcess* utilize AsyncSequence (AsyncStream), which is part of version 2.8.2, a feature that continuously listens for data. A few days ago, I modified parts of the new *RsyncProcessStreaming* package to try it as well. AsyncSequence is a robust concurrency feature, but attempting to use it in the new package caused the "empty stats file" issue again. 

The latest version, 2.8.4, incorporates the version of the *RsyncProcessStreaming* package that eliminates the occurrence of the "empty stats file."

</div>

I am uncertain as to why the AsyncStream encounters issues with the aforementioned problem. Nevertheless, I intend to investigate and determine if I can resolve this issue for my own learning and interest. Specifically, I will implement a mechanism to halt the process and drain any remaining data before the termination task is executed.

### Major Features & Improvements

- **Total Commits (git) Since 2.8.2**: 137+
- **Development Period**: December 12-24, 2025

#### 🔄 RsyncProcessStreaming Migration - Complete
- **Unified Process Execution Model**: All process execution now uses the `RsyncProcessStreaming` package for event-driven, streaming process handling
- **Simplified Handler Management**: Introduced `ProcessHandlers` factory with built-in cleanup hooks to prevent memory leaks and retain cycles
- **Real-time Output Streaming**: Process output is now streamed in real-time, enabling immediate UI updates and better user feedback
- **Files Updated**: Estimate.swift, Execute.swift, RestoreTableView.swift, OneTaskDetailsView.swift, ExecutePushPullView.swift, VerifyTasks.swift

#### 📦 ParseRsyncOutput Swift Package Integration
- **Extracted rsync output parsing** into a reusable Swift Package for improved code reusability and testability
- **Unified parsing logic** across all rsync output processing operations
- **Package repository**: [ParseRsyncOutput](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/ParseRsyncOutput)

#### ✅ Comprehensive Testing Framework
- **New RsyncUITests target** added with initial test suite
- **UI tests** for arguments and deeplink URLs
- **Output processing tests** covering:
  - Tail trimming (20-line limit)
  - Directory line filtering
  - Error detection patterns
  - Malformed/empty output edge cases

### Core Changes

#### Process Execution & Streaming
- Refactored `ObservableRestore` to use `RsyncProcessStreaming`
- Refactored task verification to use streaming process handlers
- Added streaming support to QuicktaskView
- Refactored rsync version check to use streaming process
- Remove RsyncProcess dependency - replaced with RsyncProcessStreaming
- Streaming handler cleanup refactoring to prevent retain cycles and memory leaks

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Improved UI feedback** for task progress and completion
- **Enhanced progress view** with better styling and layout
- Added configuration table view to ProfileView
- Renamed table column from 'Time' to 'Time last' across multiple views
- Refactored profile deletion UI in ProfileView
- Improved help text for --delete parameter usage
- Better handling of hiddenID in Estimate and Execute operations
- Removed RsyncRealtimeView and related obsolete UI references

#### Code Quality & Refactoring
- **Refactor optional handling patterns** with guard-chain flattening and single binding for counts
- **Refactor enum cases** to camelCase: RsyncCommand, PushPullCommand, OtherRsyncCommand, PlanSnapshots, DayOfWeek
- **Variable naming improvements** for consistency and clarity across codebase
- **Removed unnecessary whitespace** and improved code formatting
- **SwiftLint configuration updates** and inline rule directives
- **Refactored UI views** for improved readability (AddTaskView, SidebarMainView, TasksView, QuicktaskView)
- **Refactored parameter field handling** in configuration models with optional fields

#### Configuration & Settings
- **New argument validation feature**: Added toggle for argument validation in execution flow
- Added 'validate arguments' setting to user configuration
- Improved argument validation with nil checks and proper error handling
- Add dry-run validation to argument checks
- Configuration model improvements with optional parameter handling

#### Logging & Debugging
- Refactored and cleaned up logging and test code
- Removed rsync output logfile support from log views
- Gated per-line streaming logs behind DEBUG flag
- Added debug threading check for streaming handlers
- Silenced debug print statements in streaming handlers
- Improved logging to use `errorMessageOnly` with better formatting

#### Dependencies & Version Updates
- Updated all Swift package dependencies to main branch

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- Fixed guard statement order and typo in snapshot and restore operations
- Safely unwrap streamingHandlers before use
- Remove unnecessary `[weak self]` in processTermination handlers
- Made parameter4 optional to better handle delete flag
- Fix potential nil issues in argument execution

### Architecture Improvements
- **Unified streaming architecture** with simplified process lifecycle
- **Improved memory management** through explicit cleanup patterns
- **Enhanced testability** with extracted ParseRsyncOutput package
- **Better separation of concerns** through handler factory pattern

## Dependencies Updated
- RsyncProcessStreaming (streaming process execution)
- ParseRsyncOutput (output parsing and processing)
- RsyncArguments (rsync command arguments)
- RsyncProcess (legacy - being phased out in favor of streaming)
