Following the development of an adjusting output feature for rsync, I have identified a critical issues concerning the *default version of rsync in macOS and RsyncUI*. A new version of RsyncUI, version 2.7.1, will be released, which will impose certain restrictions on the operations permitted when using the default version of rsync in macOS. These restrictions will only permit standard synchronization tasks and will prohibit *snapshot* or *syncremote* tasks.

I strongly recommend that all users of RsyncUI install the latest version of rsync. There are several methods to install the latest version of rsync. One method is to use Homebrew. Please search for instructions on how to obtain and securely install the latest version of rsync. Homebrew is one option.

### One issue about openrsync and RsyncUI

Below is an illustration of a problem encountered with `openrsync`. The task in question is a `syncremote` task, which involves pulling the latest date from a remote server. However, using the latest version of rsync, version 3.1x, it is indicated that there are data to be transferred.

When utilizing the default version of rsync, openrsync, it is observed that no data is available for transfer. The underlying issue lies in the manner in which RsyncUI interprets the output generated by rsync.

### Openrsync

The default `/usr/bin/rsync` on macOS Sonoma vs macOS Sequoia and macOS Tahoe differ in their versions. All versions adhere to protocol 29 of version 2.6.9, but the licenses for these versions are distinct. Additionally, there may be variations in the code. In macOS Sonoma, the default version is version 2.6.9, released in November 2006. In macOS Sequoia and macOS Tahoe, the default version is a compatible rsync based on the BSD license. The command `/usr/bin/rsync --version` in macOS Sequoia and macOS Tahoe displays `openrsync: protocol version 29, rsync version 2.6.9 compatible`.
