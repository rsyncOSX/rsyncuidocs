{{< alert >}}

There are input from a user, see last on page. All input will be evaluated and a fix will be added as part of the developing the new release. There has been several UI-updates and cleanups of the UI within the latest release candidate.

{{< /alert >}}

Major updates in the new **updated** release candidate May 10, 2025:

- a new calendar for schedule actions, please read about the scheduler below before commence using it
    - to delete a schedule, just select it and press the back space button
- the Verify Remote is now **not** enabled by default, enable in User settings
  - the Verify Remote function is slightly changed as well
    - please read about the function in section Verify Remote 
- update changes in User settings is now manual update, the automated save settings when changed did not work 100%
- there is a new view for Verify Tasks
    - the verify buttons, play icon, in Tasks and Rsync parameters are removed
    - the new view is very explicit about dry-run parameter is enabled
- German and Norwegian localization are deleted
- the Tasks view is cleaned up, new help button for info add and delete the --delete parameter to rsync
    - add or delete, by default not added when new tasks
- the Rsync parameters view is cleaned up, new help button for info add and delete the --delete parameter to rsync
- the annoying popup when adding SSH-keys in Tasks and SSH-settings are removed and replaced
    - the values added are marked red text until values are compliant with validated input
    - example, if you add like `22d` in SSH port number, the text is marked red until the letter `d` is removed

{{< alert >}}

The scheduler is implemented by using the Timer library, quote Apple: *"A timer that fires after a certain time interval has elapsed, sending a specified message to a target object."*  The timer has a strong reference to the run loop on the main thread. That also means that if the application goes to sleep, so does the run loop. And the timer is only active as long as RsyncUI is active. 

Its primary function is to automate selected synchronization of tasks as long as RsyncUI is alive. It *may* prove useful for users who require scheduled  synchronization of data during work. 

RsyncUI may be minimized or not the active window and the timer will still work. But if you leave your Mac and it goes to sleep, the timer will not work.

{{< /alert >}}

The Norwegian and German localization are also been deleted from this version. Regrettably, due to my limited proficiency in German, I am unable to provide a comprehensive translation in German. From this version, RsyncUI speaks English only.Â

### Input from a user

Below are valuable input from a user. All input will be evaluated and corrected as part of making a new release in June 2025. There are more inputs, and I will read and add more inputs as I read through them. Additionally, every fix in the code will have a comment below every input.

#### Nr 1 - seems not to be an issue

It isn't clear what the tool does with Catalogs with spaces in the name. If I add escapes (\\), then the Estimation and Verification tasks freak out because they apparently run their commands with the directory enclosed in quotes. But the Rsync parameters interface does not show quotes around the directory name, and the rsync command should fail as shown.

- Using spaces **does not** requiere any special actions, RsyncUI accept spaces, it seems like rsync treats space like any other character.
- To create a Remote catalog with space on Debian requiere the following command : `mkdir Blackmagic\ Design`.
- The local Catalog also includes cataloges with space, the remote accepts spaces with no special actions.

{{< figure src="/images/251/space.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The computed rsync command includes spaces, no escape characters needed. The only escape character needed is if you explicit are creating a destination catalog  on the Linux host including a space in catalog name. 

{{< figure src="/images/251/space2.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

#### Nr 2 - updated

*If I put double quotes around the directory name under Tasks, then for some reason the tool adds a trailing / even if this option is turned off for the Task (and the option is uneditable after the task is created, and undiscernible in Dark mode - that is, it's impossible to tell what you chose just by looking at the greyed out checkbox). 2. With 1 and 2 in mind, I am not able to identify why a "synchronization" task passes both Estimate and Verify tasks, but a syncremote task passes Estimate but fails Verify due to rsync errors. I'm also not able to determine where do I find the rsync errors from the Verify action? Are they in a log somewhere?*

- Double quotes are not allowed in catalog names, they are now removed in code
- RsyncUI does ALLOW spaces in catalognames, no need for either double quote or escape character
- manually creating a catalog on a remote Linux server requiere using escape character

Need some development to take care of the trailing "/", should be able to remove it by update.

#### Nr 3 - updated

*What are we supposed to do for synchronization vs syncremote? Should we flip the directories or not under "Tasks"? If I don't flip them, the rsync command with the user and IP does not produce correctly.*

- This is **fixed**, in current release the Catalog parameters are flipped by RsyncUI - the fix now does the flipping hided for the user. Within the Tasks view
- Local Catalog is **always** the **first Catalog** in Tasks view
- Remote Catalog is **always** the **second Catalog** in Tasks view
- A syncremote pull data from a remote which require that Catalog parameters compared to a normal synchronize task are flipped. RsyncUI now flip this catalog hided for the user.

#### Nr 4 - updated 

*It is not clear that --dry-run is automatically imposed IF I don't hit "play", but it is excluded if I hit "play". Grok had to explain it to me. There's a neato "--dry-run" toggle under Restore, and I wonder why you didn't implement that for the main sync tool sections.*

- There is a **new view** for Verify task, the play button is removed from both Tasks and Rsync parameters view. The new view is also state clearly an estimate includes --dry-run.
- Adding a --dry-run toggle for the main synchronize tasks is not possible, please read the section "Synchronize data". Executing tasks, either by shortcut, by magic wand on toolbar ALWAYS start with an estimation run, requiered to make the progress bar work

#### Nr 5 - updated

*Why are the backup switch and SSH parameter options tied together with a toggle? Why does the SSH parameter need a switch at all, and it doesn't seem like the switch affects the SSH parameter or the port.*

- The view is cleaned up and the Backup switch is moved
- There is also a new help button about the --delete parameter, 

#### Nr 6 - investigating needed

*Why do I need to "hack" extra SSH options in the task specific SSH field? (such as -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no) It's especially confusing since that field appears to have an annoying validation when you first start typing in it (a modal popup).*

I need to investigate this issue. I wll change to Alert, modal popup, but the parameters are originally only for user selected SSH-key and SSH-port number. I will investiate if possible to add other SSH options, and the modal popup will be changed.

#### Nr 7 - no updates needed

*Please consolidate the logs in one place. There is a log button in Synchronize that leads to a window where latest updates are at the bottom and have to be scrolled down to. Also this log just smashes together output for all Tasks, and doesn't separate by Tasks. There's no log for Verify or Estimate. Every flow should just have a log so that we can troubleshoot rsync responses, as well as what the file sync actions or determinations are.*

RsyncUI only create log records AFTER a sucessfull synchronization of data. It is not possible to store *every* output from rsync, output from rsync might be huge. And by any command in RsyncUI it is possibe to inspect to output from RsyncUI. If there are discovered errors in output, an error is thrown and the user can inspect the output.

The logview always presents the most recent logs at top, not bottom. When opening the view and there are more than one task, the view show all log records. Most recent logs at top.

{{< figure src="/images/251/alllogs.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

If a task is selected, only log records for that task is presented. Most recent at top.

{{< figure src="/images/251/selectedlogs.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

How to inspect the output from rsync by an estimate run. The view is presented as part of en estimation run, please read the documentation section "Synchronize data"

{{< figure src="/images/251/estimate.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Selection a row presents the output from rsync. Blue numbers indicates there are data to be synchronized.

{{< figure src="/images/251/estimatedetails.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

#### Nr 8 - to be updated

*Why would the "Don't add /" be non-editable for Tasks after they are created? I understand the decision behind keeping sync/syncremote non editable after create.*

See answer to nr 2

#### Nr 9 - no updates 

*Confirm Execute should be a default on, imo.*

See answer to nr 4.

#### Nr 10 - updated

*Instead of popups, possibly you could look to web forms as an inspiration. Fields that don't "validate" could be marked with a red border, and maybe even a small note underneath (like "this needs to be formatted starting with ~/". As long as fields don't validate, then the "submit" type actions would not proceed.*

- The popus are removed, values are marked with red text until validated OK
