### Version 2.6.6 (build 160) - August 28, 2025

This maintenance release addresses a bug in the Quick task function. Additionally, there are some minor user interface updates and internal refactoring. The internal refactoring involves code cleanup and renaming of certain functions.

I have also been using RsyncUI on my second Mac, which has installed macOS 26 Tahoe. It functions as expected, without any unexpected issues. The next version of RsyncUI will be released when macOS Tahoe is released.
