### Version 2.8.6 - Jan 9, 2026

This release is a maintenance update. *The previous release candidate has been upgraded to the new release without the need for a new build.*

There are a few UI updates.

The [Verify remote](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/advanced/verify/) functionality has been removed and will be integrated into its own application. This change will enhance RsyncUI's focus on its core functionality, which is data synchronization.

For further details, please refer to the following documents:

- a detailed [Changelog](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- a [Code Quality Report](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/QUALITY_ANALYSIS_DETAILED.md)

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

The "missing stats alert" continues to occasionally appear. The package responsible for controlling the rsync process has been updated in development to resolve this issue. While I am aware of the cause of the problem, finding a solution that does not require setting a dedicated wait time appears to be somewhat challenging. However, I am actively working on this matter. To be released in next version.

In addition (in development), I have incorporated writing debug data within the package that processes the output from rsync. Whenever the "no stats" error is encountered, the package writes the complete output to storage for further investigation.

</div>

### The debug data when error

Upon incorporating debug data into the package responsible for processing the output generated by rsync, I successfully obtained the initial debug message in the test environment. Please refer to the following information, which elucidates the cause of the error encountered by RsyncUI and the expected output. 

An error was encountered with this output. The output is missing after the line `File list size:`. The complete output is provided below, there are six lines missing. Therefore, my assumptions are correct. Now, I need to determine how to delay the termination until all data has been read.

### Empty stats file (no stats)

The process termination signal indicates that the external rsync process has completed and the process has been terminated. All tasks within the main synchronize view are updated with the latest run, but there is also a separate logging that records the main result of each task with a timestamp.

Occasionally, when synchronizing a small amount of data, the termination signal is detected before all output from rsync has been drained. In such cases, the separate logging may be missing. The process termination signal serves as a message to perform logging, but if the last summarized rsync output is missing, there is nothing to log. 

*Output from rsync* refers to the information that rsync provides to the terminal during the execution of a task.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

If RsyncUI detects an empty statistics file, it will append a default log record stating `0 files : 0.00 MB in 0.00 seconds`.

</div>

If logging fails due to the aforementioned reason, this error will be generated, if *enabled*.
