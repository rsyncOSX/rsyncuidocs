### Version 2.8.6 - Jan 7, 2026 in development

In the upcoming release, there are no significant changes. The user interface still requires further refinement in certain areas. Additionally, I am actively working on refactor code based on AI recommendations and SwiftLint rules.

Furthermore, I am removing the [Verify remote](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/advanced/verify/) function into its own application. This move will enhance RsyncUI’s focus on its core functionality, which is data synchronization.

Next version to be released within a week.
