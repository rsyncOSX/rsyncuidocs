### Version 2.8.6 - Jan 8, 2026 release candidate

The release candidate will be the next release without a new build if no bugs are reported within the next few days.

In the upcoming release, there are no significant changes. The user interface still requires further refinement in certain areas. Additionally, I am actively working on refactor code based on AI recommendations and SwiftLint rules.

Furthermore, I am removing the [Verify remote](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/advanced/verify/) function into its own application. This move will enhance RsyncUI’s focus on its core functionality, which is data synchronization.

The following documents may be of interest, authored by artificial intelligence (AI):

- a detailed [Changelog](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- a [Code Quality Report](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/QUALITY_ANALYSIS_DETAILED.md)
