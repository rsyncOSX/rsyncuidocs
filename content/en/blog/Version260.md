### Version 2.6.0 (build 154) - work in progress 

I have commenced development of next version by using Xcode 26 beta which includes Swift version 6.2. This version of code is checked in at GitHub as branch `version-2.6.0-xcode26`.  This version is also checked in on `main branch`, removing one specific attribute for Xcode 26 beta only.  

The object for writing logfile is refactored to an actor. There will also be some new minor GUI enhancements to this version when released. 

When Apple releases a *public beta* of macOS 26 Tahoe, I will install it and investigate if I will adapt some  macOS 26 Tahoe specific changes to RsyncUI. RsyncUI will still be **supported** for the last three versions of macOS.
