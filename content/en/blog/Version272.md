### Version 2.7.2 (build 163), dev build - September 20, 2025

In Swift 6.2 on macOS Tahoe 26, the issue with plurals and the `inflect` keyword has been resolved. Plurals are now managed manually. Additionally, there are some other GUI updates, including the display of minutes, hours, or days with correct plurals.

For comprehensive details regarding the modifications, kindly consult the files that underwent changes within the release page.

The developer build will be periodically updated. New builds will be communicated through the changelog.
