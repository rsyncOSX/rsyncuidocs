### Version 2.7.2 (build 163), dev build - September 20, 2025

In Swift 6.2 on macOS Tahoe 26, the issue with plurals and the `inflect` keyword has been resolved. Plurals are now managed manually. Additionally, there are some other GUI updates, including the display of minutes, hours, or days with correct plurals.

For detailed information about the changes, please refer to the files changed within the release page.

The developer build will be periodically updated. New builds will be communicated through the changelog.

### SSH jump hosts

In response to a user's request, I have created a test build for RsyncUI that includes SSH jump hosts. However, I have not received any feedback since releasing the test build. If you are currently using SSH jump hosts, please contact me to schedule a test of RsyncUI with these features. I would be interested in incorporating this functionality into RsyncUI as a feature.
