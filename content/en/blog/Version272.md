### Version 2.7.2 (build 163), dev build - September 20, 2025

In Swift 6.2 on macOS Tahoe 26, the issue with plurals and the `inflect` keyword has been resolved. Plurals are now managed manually. Additionally, there are some other GUI updates, including the display of minutes, hours, or days with correct plurals.

For detailed information about the changes, please refer to the changelog.
