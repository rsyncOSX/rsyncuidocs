### Version 2.8.2 (build 173) - not yet released

I have initiated a comprehensive code formatting cleanup utilizing [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat), and [periphery](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery). Despite using these tools for several years, some cleanup was still required.

As a result, numerous code modifications have been made, primarily due to the formatting adjustments implemented using the aforementioned tools.

All of these tools are widely recognized and utilized by numerous developers. Notably, these tools do not alter the underlying code but rather provide formatting enhancements.

Additionally, there will be some code refactoring, which will be informed about later in December 2025.
