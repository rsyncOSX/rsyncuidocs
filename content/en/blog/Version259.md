### Version 2.5.9 (build 153) - not yet released

This blog serves as a notification regarding the upcoming version of RsyncUI. In the previous released version, 2.5.5, I implemented a refactoring of the profile picker to enable the handling of nil values, following a tutorial I discovered. Upon further examination of the code, I conducted additional cleanup and eliminated unnecessary code. The code within the most recent released version adheres to the expected behavior. However, whenever possible, I strive to achieve the same result with lesser code.

The above is one example of cleanup. And this is the major work in next version, cleanup of code. And there *may* be some minor enhancements as well. To be released sometime in July 2025. 

The GitHub repository is updated. You may browse changes in code by view  [latest release](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases/tag/v2.5.8). The main repository is committed with latest changes.
