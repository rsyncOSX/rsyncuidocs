RsyncUI is a GUI only on top of rsync.

RsyncUI is a *Swift* and *SwiftUI* based macOS application, built for macOS Sonoma and later, utilizing the command line tool *rsync* for
synchronizing files. It is rsync which executes the synchronizing tasks, not RsyncUI. RsyncUI is a GUI only ontop of rsync.
RsyncUI is *signed* and *notarized* by Apple.
